# Section 3: Compiler Infrastructure and Testing

Welcome to your third discussion section of CS 164!

Section is not graded in any wayâ€”it is meant to solidify your understanding of
the concepts discussed in lecture, and provide you additional practice with the
concepts necessary to complete your homework.

### Goals

The goal of this section is to prepare you for the infrastructure of Homework 2
and the homeworks thereafter. Specifically, this section will cover:

- The typical directory layout for homeworks going forward.
- The differential tester and writing good test examples.
- The compiler runtime.
- (Bonus) Running the interpreter and compiler manually.

## 1. Directory layout (0 subtasks)

These are the directories you'll need to modify in this section and in homework
assignments:

- **[examples/](./examples)**: Interpreter and compiler examples. You will add
  test cases here every time you implement a new language feature.
- **[lib/](./lib)**: The interpreter and compiler implementation. Typically,
  you will modify both [lib/interp.ml](./lib/interp.ml) and
  [lib/compile.ml](./lib/compile.ml) in each homework. Sometimes you will also
  need to modify [lib/runtime/runtime.c](./lib/runtime/runtime.c), which
  defines the runtime for our language.

These are the directories we provide for you that you won't need to modify (feel
free to take a look, though!):

- **[asm/](./asm)**: A library for producing assembly programs.
- **[s_exp/](./s_exp)**: A library for working with S-expressions.
- **[test/](./test)**: A library for differentially testing your interpreter
  and compiler (explained in the next section).
- **[bin/](./bin)**: The "main" functions for the interpreter and compiler.

## 2. Writing differential tests (1 subtask)

*Differential testing* is a form of software testing in which you:

1. Execute different implementations of the same  functionality (e.g., GCC and
   LLVM) with the same inputs.
2. Compare their outputs.
3. Report any anomalies as bugs.

(Definition courtesy of [Mayur Naik's slides](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/edu/cis700/lessons/differential_testing.pdf).)

For this class, you'll be writing compilers and interpreters side-by-side, and
they should agree on all possible inputs---so differential testing is a perfect
fit!

In fact, for most of the remaining homeworks for this class, we will provide you
with a `test` library that performs differential testing of your interpreter and
compiler. You can run all your tests that you create using this library with the
following command:

```sh
dune runtest -f
```

Speaking of using this library, there are three main ways to do so!

### Option 1: Testing the interpreter and compiler against an output

When you want to test if the result of a program (e.g. `(add1 41)`) is as
expected (e.g. `42`), you should:

- Write a program in the language you are implementing in a file with extension
  `.lisp` in the `examples/` directory (e.g. `examples/test42.lisp`).
- Write the expected output in a file with the same name as the `.lisp` file but
  with a `.out` extension in the `examples` directory (e.g.
  `examples/test42.out`).

### Option 2: Testing the interpreter and compiler on buggy programs

Some programs are expected to result in an error instead of a value. For
example, `(add2 40)` should result in an error because `add2` is not a valid
primitive. To test this behavior, you can use a `.err` file instead of a `.out`
one. The content of `.err` files are only used to print out failing test cases,
so you can add whatever description you'd like there.

### Option 3: Purely differential interpreter and compiler testing

When you want to test __only__ if the interpreter and the compiler agree on the
result of a program, you may leave out the `.out` file.

**Task 2.1:** Take a look at `lib/interp.ml` and/or `lib/compile.ml` to see what
language the interpreter and compiler support. Write three different tests for
the interpreter and compiler, each using a different mechanism of the three
listed above provided by the `test` library.

### A shorthand

As a convenience, you can also provide a file `examples/examples.csv` of the
following format:
```
input program 0, expected output 0
input program 1, expected output 1
... etc
```
By using the convenience file `examples/examples.csv`, you can write multiple
input-output tests all in one file that correspond to Option 1 above.

If you omit the "expected output" column for a row, the testing framework will
perform a purely differential test, which corresponds to Option 3 above.

Note that the `examples/examples.csv` shorthand does not support any equivalent
of `.err` files (Option 2 above), so you cannot use this shorthand to check
that your interpreter and compiler both throw an exception.

## 3. Working with the compiler runtime (3 subtasks)

Updating the compiler typically involves modifying
[lib/compile.ml](./lib/compile.ml).
If you introduce a new _kind_ of data, you will also need to modify
[lib/runtime/runtime.c](./lib/runtime/runtime.c)
because, for example, `print_value` needs to know how to print the new data.

_Hint:_ For more information about the compiler runtime, check out the
[first set of lecture notes](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/fa23/notes/00-What-Is-A-Compiler.html)!

_Note:_ It's strongly recommended to write tests before modifying the
compiler, interpreter, or runtime, so you can be more sure that any changes you
make do not result in any unintentional consequences.

**Task 3.1:** Change the compiler such that both booleans and numbers use 1 bit for
tagging. Booleans should be tagged with `0` and numbers with `1`.

**Task 3.2:** Change the interpreter and the compiler such that the boolean `true`
is printed as `#t` and the boolean `false` is printed as `#f`

**Task 3.3:** Implement `bool?`, which returns `true` if its argument is a boolean,
and `false` otherwise.

## 4. Bonus: Running the interpreter and compiler manually (2 subtasks)

_Note:_ Strictly speaking, you don't need to use any of the commands in this
section. Most of the time, you'll just want to use `dune runtest -f` as
described above!

Suppose there is a file `program.lisp` that contains the following code:

```scheme
(add1 41)
```

To run the interpreter on this file, run the following command:

```sh
dune exec -- bin/interp.exe program.lisp 
```

To run the compiler on this program, run the following command:

```sh
dune exec -- bin/compile.exe program.lisp ./out/
```

There will then be two files in `out/`:

- `program.lisp.exe`: The executable.
- `program.lisp.s`: The assembly of `program.lisp`. You may want to read this
  file when debugging.

You can run the executable (i.e., the compiled code) with the following command:
```sh
./out/program.lisp.exe 
```

**Task 4.1:** Interpret the 3 testing programs that you just wrote.

**Task 4.2:** Compile and run the 3 testing programs that you just wrote.
