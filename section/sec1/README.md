# Section 1: Introduction to OCaml

Welcome to your first discussion section of CS 164!

Section is not graded in any wayâ€”it is meant to solidify your understanding
of the concepts discussed in lecture.

## Content

This section is meant to help you familiarize yourself with the OCaml language
and its various features. Each module has:

1. A `demo.ml` file that you can follow along during the lecture part of
   section,
1. An `exercises.ml` file that contains exercises for you to complete, and
1. A `test.ml` file that contains tests for your exercises.

To test your solutions, run `dune runtest -f` in the subdirectory corresponding to
the module that you want to test.

You can also load up `dune utop` in each subdirectory, then enter the command
`#use "demo.ml";;` (or whatever file you want to load) to explore using the
REPL.

### Modules

1. Lists
2. Recursive functions
3. Testing (`test.ml` includes both the demo and the exercises)

Many of the exercises are borrowed from
[Functional Programming in OCaml, Spring 2019 edition](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019sp/textbook/).

## Structure

This section will begin with a brief lecture on the first module. After this
lecture, you will break into groups and work on the first set of exercises
together. (We recommend trying out pair programming, but that is not a
requirement!) After some period of time, we will ask the groups to reconvene and
share their solutions with the class. We will repeat this process for as many
modules as we can get through!

We will likely not get through all the modules, so do not feel rushed; whatever
remains at the end is valuable for self-study.
